        <h5>Algorithm:</h5>
        <p>
            The publication shown on the page is the one having the biggest score. The score is initialized to the ETH value paid to the smart contract. Over time its value decreases. The reduction of the score is calculated from the total time a publication was on the front page. It follows a quadratic function where an hour is equal to 0.05 ETH and 1 day to 1 ETH
